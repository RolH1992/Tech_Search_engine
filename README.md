# Tech_Search_engine
This is a search engine that reads .csv files using Streamlit with a Python library for building web applications. 

Please note I built a enviroment with in a linux terminal:

$ source ~/myenv/bin/activate
$ pip install streamlit
$ pip install txtai
$ pip install panda
$ pip install numpy

I could recommend .csv files from Kaggle
